# SwissGeoDataPlayground
Using Swiss map data from map.geo.admin.ch


### Overview
This project visualizes geospatial data from an .xyz file using 3D plotting techniques. The data is read, processed, and displayed as a 3D surface plot with color mapping based on terrain elevation.

### Features
Read geospatial coordinates from an .xyz file.
Perform Delaunay triangulation on the coordinates.
Visualize the triangulated surface in 3D.
Color mapping based on terrain elevation.

## Test data download
The data has been downloaded [here](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/hoehenmodell-swissalti3d)

## Data info
.xyz data was used for testing and a 10m distance was used for performance reasons
